# Reading the System Log

`journalctl` is your interface into a single machine's journal/logging and `fleetctl journal` will fetch the journal for containers started with [fleet]({{site.url}}/using-coreos/clustering/). All service files and docker containers insert data into the systemd journal. There are a few helpful commands to read the journal:

## Read the Entire Journal

```sh
$ journalctl

-- Logs begin at Fri 2013-12-13 23:43:32 UTC, end at Sun 2013-12-22 12:28:45 UTC. --
Dec 22 00:10:21 localhost systemd-journal[33]: Runtime journal is using 184.0K (max 49.9M, leaving 74.8M of free 499.0M, current limit 49.9M).
Dec 22 00:10:21 localhost systemd-journal[33]: Runtime journal is using 188.0K (max 49.9M, leaving 74.8M of free 499.0M, current limit 49.9M).

## Read Entries for a Specific Service

Read entries generated by a specific unit:

```sh
$ journalctl -u apache.service

-- Logs begin at Fri 2013-12-13 23:43:32 UTC, end at Sun 2013-12-22 12:32:52 UTC. --
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost systemd[1]: Starting Apache Service...
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost systemd[1]: Started Apache Service.
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost docker[9772]: /usr/sbin/apache2ctl: 87: ulimit: error setting limit (Operation not permitted)
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost docker[9772]: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.6 for ServerName
```

Using the `--tunnel` flag ([docs](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/blob/master/Documentation/using-the-client.md#from-an-external-host)), you can remotely read the journal for a specific unit started via [fleet]({{site.url}}/using-coreos/clustering/). This command will figure out which machine the unit is currently running on, fetch the journal and output it:

```sh
$ fleetctl --tunnel 10.10.10.10 journal apache.service

-- Logs begin at Fri 2013-12-13 23:43:32 UTC, end at Sun 2013-12-22 12:32:52 UTC. --
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost systemd[1]: Starting Apache Service...
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost systemd[1]: Started Apache Service.
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost docker[9772]: /usr/sbin/apache2ctl: 87: ulimit: error setting limit (Operation not permitted)
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost docker[9772]: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.6 for ServerName
```

## Read Entries Since Boot

Reading just the entires since the last boot is an easy way to troubleshoot services that are faiing to start properly:

```sh
journalctl --boot
```

## Tail the Journal

You can tail the entire journal or just a specific service:

```sh
journalctl -f
```

```sh
journalctl -u apache.service -f
```
